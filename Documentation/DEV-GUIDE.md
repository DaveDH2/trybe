## Sublime Text 3
Sublime Text 3 is the chosen editor for members of the Trybe project. You can use whatever text editor or IDE you choose, however using Sublime Text with the settings described below will make it easier to adhear to project style guide and coding standards.

### Project File (trybe.sublime-project)

### Plugins

Project plugins are seprated to the groups 'suggested', 'linters', and 'themes'. The suggested plugins are optional but strongly recommended for project synchronicity.  The linters are manditory.  A small amount of study is required ahead of configuration.  Themes are optional but installing at least one of them is recommended, as they will help with linter highlighting, sidebar organization, and more.

#### Suggested Plugins

* Sidebar Enhancements
* DocBlockr
* Fileâ€‹Header
* Markdown Preview
* Alignment
* JavaScriptNext ES6 Syntax
* Bracket Highlighter
* Pretty JSON
* Emmet
* Color Highlighter
* SCSS (text mate bundle)
* Jasmine JS

#### Linter Plugins

Remember to [Read The Docs](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/latest/index.html) before installing! For information specific to connecting your linters to Sublime Text themes, [check out the usage page](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/latest/usage.html).

* SublimeLinter
* SublimeLinter-jshint
* SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint

#### Themes

Themes are optional. Your theme selection is largely a matter of preference. The most useful themes can be combined with linters to present graphic feedback on warnings and errors.  For example, ITG Flat, a project-favorite theme, can be setup inside `Preferences.sublime-settings` to affect Sublime Text's theme and color scheme.

```
{
  "color_scheme": "Packages/User/SublimeLinter/itg.dark (SL).tmTheme",
  "show_color_scheme_info": true,
  "theme": "itg.flat.dark.sublime-theme"
}
```
